                    <p>Orphans are a very vunerable group of children whose 
                        parents are no longer alive. In most cases, after the 
                        demise of the parents,they are left to suffer on their 
                        own and are not able to get basic needs.

                        <p>In 2020,following the Covid-19 pandemic,the government 
                            started a foundation where orphans could stay. However,
                            that has not been the case as the streets of Nairobi are 
                            still filled with them</p>
