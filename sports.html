    <h3>Transfer News</h3>
    <article>
        <p>After the Winter transfer season came to an end with many suprising transfers,many
            football fans are waiting eargerly for the summer transfers. Although many speculations
            already been made regarding players such as Alphonso Davies,Armando Broja and Victor
            Osimhen,nothing is yet to be confirmed. No comment has been made from the players or
            the agents.</p>

            However,some transfers really look inevitable. Some players have already made their
            stand that they would not be remaining at their current club after the end of this
            current season. An example would be Kyllian Mbappe. The young French player has already
            made his choice and has confirmed that he will be leaving <i> Paris St Germain</i> this
            summer. Actions from the player himself and the coach,Luis Enrique have proven that the
            player will indeed be leaving. This has been due to Mbappe's surprising subtitutions and
            his recent actions one of them being that after his substitution at half time,he did not join
            fellow players at the bench but he instead changed and went to join his mother at the stands
            to watch the game. According to Fabrizio Romano,Luis Enrique is trying to get the teammates to
            get used to playing without Mbappe. The likely successor to the iconic Number Seven shirt is
            Ousmane Dembele. Mbappe is suspected to be moving to Real Madrid and some think that the contact
            has already been finalized.
